"""checkmap.py -- prove the code/data split in tools/tennis.cfg.

`make verify-org` assembles the generated disassembly and requires the
cartridge dump back, byte for byte. That is necessary and NOT sufficient: a
run of DATA bytes disassembled as instructions re-encodes to exactly the bytes
it came from, so a wrong split survives the round trip untouched. Video
Olympics' PORTING.md says it plainly -- an automatic pass loses everything an
absolute-indirect JMP would have reached, and the result looks fine until it
runs.

So this walks the ROM by recursive descent from the reset vector and asserts
the split is the one the descent finds:

  1. every byte DiStella emitted as CODE is reached from $F000
  2. no byte it emitted as DATA is reached
  3. the two sets together cover the image with nothing left over

Tennis is unusually well behaved here and the checker says so rather than
assuming it: the image contains no `JMP (ind)` and no RTS-dispatch, so there
is no computed control flow for the descent to lose and the answer is exact
rather than a lower bound. Both facts are asserted, because the day one of
them stops being true is the day this gate would start lying.
