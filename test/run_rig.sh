# The shape is the Intellivision family's: isolated copies of fujinet-pc so a
# run cannot disturb a real one, everything this script starts it kills first,
# and an inline verdict block rather than a human reading a log.
#
# Two things about this machine cost an afternoon each and are guarded here:
#
#   * A long-running fujinet-pc has held 127.0.0.1:9995 since September, and
#     the 2600 cartridge model connects there by DEFAULT. A rig on the default
#     port silently measures somebody else's FujiNet; ours logs "bind failed"
#     into a file nobody reads. So the rig uses its own ports and ABORTS if it
#     cannot have them.
#   * `cd "$RIG" && ./fujinet` puts "./fujinet" in the process's command line,
#     and `pkill -f "$RIG/fujinet"` then matches nothing. Every run leaked one,
#     and the next run measured the leak. Launch by absolute path.
