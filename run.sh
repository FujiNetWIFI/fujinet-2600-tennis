#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run.sh -- run a Tennis client ROM in a FujiNet-patched MAME.
#
#   ./run.sh [rom] [lua-script]
#
# With a script it runs headless and exits; without one it opens a window.
# `rom` is a basename in build/ and defaults to tennis.
#
# The MAME tree must have had fn-2600/pico/atari-2600/emu/apply.sh run against
# it, and for anything that touches the network a fujinet-pc must be listening.
#
# Four environment facts this wraps, each of which costs time to rediscover:
#   - MAME must run FROM ITS OWN TREE or -autoboot_script is silently ignored.
#   - SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy is required wherever there is no DISPLAY, because
#     SDL comes up before the video backend is chosen.
#   - fujinet-pc's BoIP listener takes ONE client, so a MAME left running
#     starves the next run and the symptom is a hang, not an error.
#   - THROTTLED IS NOT A PERFORMANCE CHOICE for anything measuring latency:
#     unthrottled, a bounded poll loop expires in wall-microseconds and the
#     measurement reports the emulator's speed rather than the transport's.

# MAME'S DEFAULT CONTROLLER IS THE RIGHT ONE HERE, and the sibling port is why
# that is worth a note rather than silence. Video Olympics is a paddle game and
# had to pass `-joyport1 pad -joyport2 pad`, because MAME defaults both slots to
# `joy` -- and with the wrong device in the slot the game still runs and every
# gate that compares two builds against each other still passes, since both
# sides are equally wrong. Tennis is a joystick game, so the default is correct
# and nothing is passed. The `-cartslot fujinet` is the part that is not a
# default: it is the FujiNet cartridge device emu/apply.sh grafts into MAME.
